# Guess_Magic_Number_JAVA

Magic Number Game With A Lot of Gamers...
To achieve this game I used thread and socket concepts in java. it's a very simple application but with lots of benefits for you.
At first, the gamer guesses a number if the number is greater than the correct number, the server requires the to guess another number, and the same thing when the number is less.
When a gamer guesses the right number, the server sends the others a message telling them the winner's name and stopping the game.
